<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Many</span> persons have advocated placing barometers at exposed
fishing villages; and the Board of Trade has sanctioned the
principle of some assistance by Government to a limited extent,
depending on the necessity of each case, and other contingencies,
such as the care, publicity, and setting of the barometers.</p>

<p>It was thought advisable to substitute a few words on the
scales of these instruments in place of those usually engraved
(which are not the most suitable), and to compile brief and plain
information respecting the use of weather-glasses.</p>

<p>The following pages were prepared; but only the first few
were intended particularly for this purpose.</p>

<p>After writing these, it was suggested that some remarks might
be added for the benefit of many persons, especially young officers
at sea, and the suggestion was complied with; yet not so as to
diminish the portability of this compilation, or increase its price.</p>

<p>These remarks, derived from the combined observation, study,
and personal experience of various individuals, are in accordance,
generally, with the results obtained by eminent philosophers.</p>

<p>The works of Humboldt, Herschel, Dov&eacute;, Sabine, Reid, Redfield,
Espy, and others, are appealed to in confirmation of this
statement.</p>

<p>To obviate any charge of undue haste, or an insufficiently considered
plan&mdash;which may be fairly brought against many novelties&mdash;the
following testimony to the first published suggestion
of such a measure is submitted.</p>

<p>In the First Report of the Committee on Shipwrecks (1843),
at pages 1, 2, 3, the following evidence was printed by order of
the House of Commons.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"I think that the neglect of the use of the barometer has led to the
loss of many ships. From a want of attention to the barometer, they
have either closed the land (if at sea), or have put to sea (being in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
harbour in safety) at improper times; and in consequence of such want
of precaution the ships have been lost, owing to bad weather coming on
suddenly, which might have been avoided had proper attention been
paid to that very simple instrument. While alluding to the use of
barometers, I may remark, that if such weather-glasses were put in
charge of the Coast-guard, at the principal stations round the coast, so
placed as to allow any one passing by to look at them, they might be
the means, not only of preventing ships from going to sea just before
bad weather was coming on, but of preventing the great losses of life
which take place every year on our coasts (particularly in the Orkney
Islands and on the coasts of Scotland and Ireland), owing to fishing
vessels and boats going to sea when bad weather is impending. No
bad weather ever comes on our coasts without timely warning being
given by the barometer. The oldest seaman are often deceived by the
look of the weather, but there is no instance on record of very bad
weather, such as would have involved loss of life to the extent we have
heard of in several years, having come on without the barometer having
given timely warning. By the very small expense of an establishment
of barometers, so placed as to be accessible to any fishermen, boatmen,
or others on the coasts, much loss of life, as well as loss of boats, and
even shipping, might be prevented.</p>

<p>"What state of the barometer indicates danger?&mdash;It varies in
different climates according to the range. The range is small between
the tropics, but very large in the higher latitudes. In our climate the
range is usually about two inches. The barometer falling considerably
below its average height is at once an indication that some considerable
change is going to take place, and when it falls low, as for instance
(in our climate) to near 29 inches, or below 29 inches, a gale is certain
to follow.</p>

<p>"Are the Committee to understand that you are of opinion that
every ship ought to have a barometer on board?&mdash;I think that every
ship ought to have either a barometer or sympiesometer, which is an
efficient substitute for a barometer.</p>

<p>"Does the barometer show a sudden change of wind as well as the
coming on of bad weather? Supposing a gale of wind is blowing, and
you are sailing with a fair wind, does the barometer show any change
of wind?&mdash;Decidedly.</p>

<p>"Supposing the wind was at West-north-west and it shifted suddenly
to West-south-west, would the barometer indicate that?&mdash;It requires
some practice to be able to say <i>exactly what is likely to take place</i>
after a change in the barometer; but the principal point for a seaman
is, that no violent wind will blow without the barometer giving warning.
He may not know exactly from what quarter the wind will come,
but no strong wind will come on without warning being given.</p>

<p>"You recommend that at the Coast-guard stations there should
be a barometer, by means of which people would know when a violent
wind was coming on; but as it would not indicate the quarter from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
which it was coming, would you have the merchant ship always remain
in port till the barometer showed fine weather?&mdash;Being accustomed to
the barometer on our coast, one could tell from what quarter the wind
would probably come by the height of the barometer, taken in connexion
with its previous height, and the state of the weather, and the
strength of winds that had prevailed before. Taking the state of the
barometer in connexion with the appearance of the weather one could
make a satisfactory conclusion as to the quarter from which any violent
wind would come. And the barometer, after very little practice, can
be used by any man. There is no difficulty in using it sufficiently to
know that danger is coming on; and if danger is coming on, a man
refrains, of course, from exposing himself to it; the quarter from which
the wind comes being of minor consequence.</p>

<p>"With a North-easterly wind, in this part of the world, the barometer
stands, on an average, about half an inch higher than with the
same strength of wind from the South-westward. All over the world
there is a similar difference proportionate to the range of the mercury
for which allowance should always be made in considering the height
of the barometer."<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p></div>

<p>In the first Number of Meteorological Papers, published by the
Board of Trade, 1857, is the following passage respecting the use
of weather-glasses:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The variety of interesting and useful, if not always important,
subjects included within the range of meteorology, is not perhaps
sufficiently realized in the minds of active participators in the world's
stirring work. Irrespective of any scientific object, how much utility
is there to all classes in what is commonly called 'weather wisdom'?
In our variable climate, with a maritime population, numbers of small
vessels, and especially fishing boats, how much life and property is
risked unnecessarily by every unforeseen storm? Even animals, birds,
and insects have a presaging instinct, perhaps a bodily feeling, that
warns them; but man often neglects his perceptive and reasoning
powers; neither himself observes, nor attends to the observations of
others, unless special inclination or circumstances stimulate attention to
the subject. Agriculturists, it is true, use weather-glasses: the sportsman
knows their value for indicating a good or bad scenting day; but
the coasting vessel puts to sea, the Shetland fisherman casts his nets,
without the benefit of such a monitor, and perhaps without the weather
wisdom which only a few possess, and cannot transfer to others.</p>

<p>"Difficult as it is to foretell weather accurately, much useful foresight
may be acquired by combining the indications of instruments
(such as the barometer, thermometer, and hygrometer) with atmospheric<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
appearances. What is more varying than the aspect of the
sky? Colour, tint of clouds, their soft or hard look, their outline, size,
height, direction, all vary rapidly, yet each is significant. There is a
peculiar aspect of the clouds before and during westerly winds which
differs from that which they have previous to and during easterly
winds, which is one only of the many curious facts connected with the
differing natures of easterly and westerly currents of air throughout the
world, which remain unchanged, whether they blow from sea to land,
or the reverse.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>"Perhaps some of those who make much use of instruments rather
undervalue popular knowledge, and are reluctant to admit that a 'wise
saw' may be valuable as well as a 'modern instance;' while less
informed persons who use weather-glasses unskilfully too often draw
from them erroneous conclusions, and then blame the barometer.</p>

<p>"Not only are reliable weather-glasses required at the smaller outlying
ports and fishing places, but plain, easily intelligible directions
for using them should be accessible to the seafaring population, so that
the masters of small vessels, and fishermen, might be forewarned of
coming changes in time to prepare for them, and thus become instrumental
in saving much property and many lives."</p></div>

<h2><a name="HOW_TO_FORETELL_WEATHER" id="HOW_TO_FORETELL_WEATHER"></a>HOW TO FORETELL WEATHER.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Familiar</span> as the practical use of weather-glasses is, at sea as
well as on land, only those who have long watched their indications,
and compared them carefully, are really able to conclude
more than that the rising glass<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> <span class="smcapl">USUALLY</span> foretells less wind or
rain, a falling barometer more rain or wind, or both; a high one
fine weather, and a low, the contrary. But useful as these general
conclusions are <i>in most cases</i>, they are <i>sometimes</i> erroneous,
and then remarks may be rather hastily made, tending to discourage
the inexperienced.</p>

<p>By attention to the following observations (the results of
many years' practice and many persons' experience) any one not
accustomed to use a barometer may do so without difficulty.</p>

<p>The barometer shows whether the air<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> is getting lighter or
heavier, or is remaining in the same state. The quicksilver falls
as the air becomes lighter, rises as it becomes heavier, and remains
at rest in the glass tube while the air is unchanged in
weight. Air presses on everything within about forty miles
of the world's surface, like a <i>much</i> lighter ocean, at the bottom
of which we live&mdash;not feeling its weight, because our bodies are
full of air, but feeling its currents, the winds. Towards any
place from which the air has been drawn by suction,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> air presses
with a force or weight of nearly fifteen pounds on a square inch
of surface. Such a pressure holds the limpet to the rock when,
by contracting itself, the fish has made a place without air<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
under its shell. Another familiar instance is that of the fly
which walks on the ceiling with feet that stick. The barometer
tube, emptied of air, and filled with pure mercury, is turned<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
down into a cup or cistern containing the same fluid, which,
feeling the weight of air, is so pressed by it as to balance a
column of about thirty inches (more or less) in the tube, where
no air presses on the top of the column.</p>

<p>If a long pipe, closed at one end only, were emptied of air,
filled with water, the open end kept in water and the pipe held
upright, the water would rise in it more than thirty feet. In
this way water barometers have been made. A proof of this
effect is shown by any well with a sucking pump&mdash;up which, as
is commonly known, the water will rise nearly thirty feet, by
what is called suction, which is, in fact, the pressure of air
towards an empty place.</p>

<p>The words on scales of barometers should not be so much regarded
for weather indications, as the rising or falling of the
mercury; for, if it stand at <i>Changeable</i>, and then rise towards
<i>Fair</i>, it presages a change of wind or weather, though not so
great, as if the mercury had risen higher; and, on the contrary,
if the mercury stand above <i>fair</i> and then fall, it presages a
change, though not to so great a degree as if it had stood lower:
besides which, the direction, and force of wind, are not in any
way noticed. It is not from the point at which the mercury
may stand that we are alone to form a judgment of the state of
the weather, but from its <i>rising</i> or <i>falling</i>; and from the movements
of immediately preceding days as well as hours, keeping in
mind effects of change of <i>direction</i>, and dryness, or moisture, as
well as alteration of force or strength of wind.</p>

<hr class="hr10" />

<p>In this part of the world, towards the higher latitudes, the
quicksilver ranges, or rises and falls, nearly three inches&mdash;namely,
between about thirty inches and nine-tenths (30&middot;9),
and less than twenty-eight inches (28&middot;0) on extraordinary occasions;
but the usual range is from about thirty inches and a half
(30&middot;5), to about twenty-nine inches. Near the Line, or in equatorial
places, the range is but a few tenths, except in storms,
when it sometimes falls to twenty-seven inches.</p>

<p>The sliding-scale (vernier) divides the tenths into ten parts each,
or hundredths of an inch. The number of divisions on the
vernier exceeds that in an equal space of the fixed scale by one.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<hr class="hr10" />

<p>By a thermometer the <i>weight</i> of air is <i>not</i> shown. No air is
within the tube. None can get in. But the bulb of the tube is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
full of mercury, which contracts by cold, and swells by heat&mdash;according
to which effect the thread of metal in the small tube
is drawn down or pushed up so many degrees: and thus shows
the temperature.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>If a thermometer have a piece of linen tied round the bulb,
wetted enough to keep it damp by a thread or wick dipping
into a cup of water, it will show less heat than a dry one, in proportion
to the dryness of the air, and quickness of drying.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> In
very damp weather, with or <i>before</i> rain, fog, or dew, two such
thermometers will be nearly alike.</p>

<p>For ascertaining the dryness or moisture of air, the readiest,
and surest method is the comparison of two thermometers; one
dry, the other <i>just</i> moistened, and <i>kept so</i>. Cooled by evaporation
as much as the state of the air admits&mdash;the moist (or wet)
bulb thermometer shows a temperature nearly equal to that of
the other one, when the atmosphere is extremely damp, or moist;
but lower at other times,&mdash;in proportion to the dryness of air,
and consequent evaporation,&mdash;as far as twelve or fifteen degrees
in this climate; twenty or even more elsewhere. From four to
eight degrees of difference is usual in England; and about seven
is considered healthy for living rooms.</p>

<p>The thermometer fixed to a barometer intended to be used
only as a weather-glass shows the temperature of air about it
nearly&mdash;but does not show the temperature of mercury within
exactly. It does so however near enough for ordinary practical
purposes&mdash;provided that no sun, nor fire, nor lamp heat is
allowed to act on the instrument partially.</p>

<p>The mercury in the cistern and tube being affected by cold or
heat, makes it advisable to consider this when endeavouring to
foretell coming weather by the length of the column.</p>

<hr class="hr10" />

<p>Briefly, the barometer shows weight or pressure of the air; the
thermometer&mdash;heat and cold, or temperature; and the wet thermometer,
compared with a dry one, the degree of moisture or
dampness.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>It should be remembered that the state of the air <i>foretells</i>,
rather than shows present weather (an invaluable fact too often
overlooked); that the longer the time between the signs and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
change foretold by them, the longer such altered weather will
last; and, on the contrary, the less the time between a warning
and a change, the shorter will be the continuance of such foretold
weather.</p>

<p>If the barometer has been about its ordinary height, say near
thirty inches, at the sea level,<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> and is steady, or rising&mdash;while
the thermometer falls, and dampness becomes less&mdash;North-westerly,
Northerly, or North-easterly wind&mdash;or less wind&mdash;may be
expected.</p>

<p>On the contrary&mdash;if a fall takes place, with a rising thermometer
and increased dampness, wind and rain may be expected
from the South-eastward, Southward, or South-westward.</p>

<p>A fall, with a low thermometer, foretells snow.</p>

<p>Exceptions to these rules occur when a North-easterly wind,
with wet (rain or snow) is impending, before which the barometer
often rises (on account of the <i>direction</i> of the coming wind
alone), and deceives persons who, from that sign only, expect fair
weather.</p>

<p>When the barometer is rather below its ordinary height, say,
below twenty-nine inches and nine-tenths (at the sea level <i>only</i>),
a rise foretells less wind, or a change in its direction towards the
Northward,&mdash;or less wet; but when the mercury<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> has been low,
say near 29 inches&mdash;the first rising usually precedes, and foretells,
strong wind&mdash;(at times heavy squalls)&mdash;from the North-westward&mdash;Northward&mdash;or
North-eastward&mdash;<i>after</i> which violence a rising
glass foretells improving weather&mdash;if the thermometer falls. But,
if the warmth continue, probably the wind will back (shift against
the sun's course), and more Southerly, or South-westerly wind
will follow. "Backing" is a bad sign, with any wind.</p>

<p>The most dangerous shifts of wind, and the heaviest Northerly<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
gales happen after the mercury first rises from a very low point.</p>

<p>Indications of approaching changes of weather, and the direction
and force of winds are shown less by the height of mercury
in the tube, than by its falling or rising. Nevertheless, a height
of about 30 inches (at the level of the sea) with a continuance of
it, is indicative of fine weather and moderate winds.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>The barometer is said to be <i>falling</i> when the mercury in the
tube is sinking, at which time its upper surface is <i>sometimes</i>
concave or hollow. The barometer is <i>rising</i> when the mercurial
column is lengthening; its upper surface being then, as in <i>general</i>,
convex or rounded.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>A rapid rise of the barometer indicates unsettled weather. A
slow rise, or steadiness, with dryness, shows fair weather.</p>

<p>A considerable and rapid fall is a sign of stormy weather and
rain. Alternate rising and sinking show very unsettled weather.</p>

<p>The greatest depressions of the barometer are with gales from
the S.E., Southward, or S.W.; the greatest elevations, with winds
from the N.W., Northward, or N.E., or when calm.</p>

<p>Although the barometer generally falls with a Southerly, and
rises with a Northerly wind, the contrary <i>sometimes</i> occurs; in
which cases the Southerly wind is dry and the weather fine; or
the Northerly wind is wet and violent.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>When the barometer sinks considerably, high wind, rain, or
snow will follow: the wind will be from the Northward if the
thermometer is low (for the season)&mdash;from the Southward if the
thermometer is high.</p>

<p>Sudden falls of the barometer, with a Westerly wind, are sometimes
followed by violent storms from N.W. or North.</p>

<p>If a gale sets in from the Eastward or S.E., and the wind veers
by the South, the barometer will continue falling until the wind
becomes S.W., when a comparative lull may occur; after which
the gale will be renewed; and the shifting of the wind towards
the N.W. will be indicated by a fall of the thermometer as well
as a rise of the barometer.</p>

<p>Three things appear to affect the mercury in a barometer:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. The direction of the wind&mdash;the North-east wind tending to
raise it most&mdash;the South-west to lower it the most, and wind from
points of the compass between them proportionally as they are
nearer one or the other extreme point.</p>

<p>N.E. and S.W. may therefore be called the wind's extreme
bearings (rather than <i>poles</i>?)</p>

<p>The range, or difference of height, of the mercury, due to
change of direction <i>only</i>, from one of these bearings to the other
(supposing strength or force, and moisture, to remain the same)<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
amounts in these latitudes to about half an inch (shown by the
barometer as read off).</p>

<p>2. The amount, taken by itself, of vapour, moisture, wet, rain,
hail, or snow, in the wind or current of air (direction and strength
remaining the same) seems to cause a change amounting, in an
extreme case, to about half an inch.</p>

<p>3. The strength or force alone of wind from any quarter
(moisture and direction being unchanged) is preceded, or foretold,
by a fall or rise, according as the strength will be greater or less,
ranging, in an extreme case, to more than two inches.</p>

<p>Hence, supposing the three causes to act together&mdash;in extreme
cases&mdash;the mercury might range from about 31 (30&middot;9) inches to
near 27 inches, which has happened <i>occasionally</i>.</p>

<p>Generally, however, as the three act much less strongly, and
are less in accord&mdash;ordinary varieties of weather (the wind varying
as usual&mdash;with more or less cloudiness, or rain) occur much
more frequently than extreme changes.</p>

<p>Another general rule requires attention; which is, that the
wind usually veers, shifts, or goes round, <i>with the sun</i>, (right-handed
in northern places, left-handed in the southern parts of
the world,) and that, when it does not do so, or backs, more
wind or bad weather may be expected instead of improvement.</p>

<p>In a barometer the mercury begins to rise occasionally before
the conclusion of gale, sometimes even at its commencement,
as the equilibrium of the atmosphere begins to be restored.
Although the mercury falls lowest before high winds, it frequently
sinks considerably before heavy rain only. The barometer
falls, but <i>not always</i>, on the approach of thunder and
lightning, or when the atmosphere is highly charged with electricity.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
Before and during the earlier part of serene and settled
weather, the mercury commonly stands high, and is stationary.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>Instances of fine weather, with a low glass, occur exceptionally,
but they are always preludes to a duration of wind or rain, <i>if
not both</i>.</p>

<p>After very warm and calm weather, rain or a storm is likely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
to occur; or at any time when the atmosphere has been <i>heated</i>
much above the usual temperature of the season.</p>

<p>Allowance should invariably be made for the previous state of
the instrument during some days as well as hours, because its
indications may be affected by remote causes, or by changes close
at hand. Some of these changes may occur at a greater or less
distance, influencing neighbouring regions, but not visible to each
observer whose barometer, nevertheless, feels their effect.</p>

<p>There may be heavy rains or violent winds beyond the horizon,
out of view of an observer, by which his instruments may be
affected considerably, though no particular change of weather
occurs in his immediate locality.</p>

<p>It may be repeated, that the longer a change of wind or
weather is foretold by the barometer before it takes place, the
longer the presaged weather will last; and, conversely, the
shorter the warning, the less time whatever causes the warning;
whether wind or a fall of rain, hail, or snow, will continue.</p>

<p>Sometimes severe weather from an equatorial<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> direction, not
lasting long, may cause no great fall of the barometer, because
followed by a <i>duration</i> of wind from polar regions:&mdash;and at
times it may fall considerably with polar winds and fine
weather, apparently against these rules, because a <i>continuance</i>
of equatorial wind is about to follow. By such changes as these
one may be misled, and calamity may be the consequence if not
thus forewarned.</p>

<p>The veering of the winds is a direct consequence of the earth's
rotation, while currents of air from the polar regions are alternating
or contending with others from the equator.</p>

<p>The polar currents are cold, dry, and heavy. Those from the
equatorial parts of the world are warm, moist, and comparatively
light. Their alternate or combined action, with the agencies of
solar heat and electricity, cause the varieties of weather that we
experience.</p>

<p>It is not intended to discourage attention to what is usually
called "weather wisdom." On the contrary, every prudent
person will combine observation of the elements with such indications
as he may obtain from instruments.</p>

<p>The more carefully and accurately these two sources of foreknowledge
are compared and combined, the more satisfactory
will the results prove.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>A few of the more marked signs of weather&mdash;useful alike to
seaman, farmer, and gardener, are the following:</p>

<p>Whether clear or cloudy, a rosy sky at sunset presages fine
weather; a red sky in the morning, bad weather, or much wind
(if not rain):&mdash;a grey sky in the morning fine weather; a high
dawn, wind; a low dawn; fair weather.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>Soft-looking or delicate clouds foretell fine weather, with
moderate or light breezes;&mdash;hard edged oily-looking clouds,
wind. A dark, gloomy, blue sky is windy;&mdash;but a light, bright
blue sky indicates fine weather. Generally, the <i>softer</i> clouds
look, the less wind (but perhaps more rain) may be expected;&mdash;and
the harder, more "greasy," rolled, tufted, or ragged, the
stronger the coming wind will prove. Also, a bright yellow sky
at sunset presages wind; a pale yellow, wet:&mdash;and thus by
the prevalence of red, yellow, or grey tints, the coming weather
may be foretold very nearly: indeed, if aided by instruments,
almost exactly.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>Small inky-looking clouds foretell rain; a light scud, driving
across heavy clouds, wind and rain; but if alone, wind only.</p>

<p>High upper clouds crossing the sun, moon, or stars, in a direction
different from that of the lower clouds, or wind then
blowing, foretell a change of wind (beyond tropical latitudes).<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>After fine clear weather the first signs (in the sky) of change
are usually small, curled, streaked, or spotty clouds, followed by
an overcasting of vapour, that grows into cloudiness. This
murky appearance, more or less oily or watery, as wind or rain
will prevail, is a sure sign. The higher and more distant the
clouds seem to be, the more gradual, but extensive, the coming
change of weather will prove.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, natural, quiet, delicate tints or colours,
with soft undefined forms of clouds, foretell fine weather: but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
gaudy or unusual hues, with hard, definite outlines, presage
rain and wind.</p>

<p>Misty clouds forming, or hanging on heights, show wind and
rain coming&mdash;if they remain, or descend. If they rise, or disperse,
the weather will improve, or become fine.</p>

<p>When sea birds fly out early, and far to seaward, moderate
wind and fair weather may be expected. When they hang
about the land, or over it, sometimes flying inland, expect a
strong wind, with stormy weather. As many creatures, besides
birds, are affected by the approach of rain or wind, such indications
should not be slighted by the observer of weather.</p>

<p>There are other signs of a coming change in the weather
known less generally than may be desirable; and, therefore
worth notice here.</p>

<p>When birds of long flight, such as swallows and others, hang
about home and fly low&mdash;rain or wind may be expected. Also
when animals seek sheltered places, instead of spreading over
their usual range: when pigs carry straw to their sties; and when
smoke from chimneys does not ascend readily, (straight upwards
during a calm,) an unfavourable change may be looked for.</p>

<p>Dew is an indication of fine weather. So is fog. Neither of
of these two formations occurs under an overcast sky, or when
there is much wind. One sees the fog occasionally rolled away,
as it were, by wind&mdash;but not formed while it is blowing.</p>

<p>Remarkable clearness of atmosphere, near the horizon; distant
objects, such as hills, unusually visible; or raised (by refraction);
and what is called "a good <i>hearing</i> day" may be mentioned
among signs of wet, if not wind, to be expected.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>More than usual twinkling of the stars; indistinctness or apparent
multiplication of the moon's horns; haloes; "wind-dogs;"
and the rainbow; are more or less significant of increasing wind,
if not approaching rain.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>Near land, in sheltered harbours, in valleys, or over low
ground, there is usually a marked diminution of wind during
part of the night&mdash;and a dispersion of clouds. At such times an
eye on an overlooking height may see an extended body of vapour
below; which the cooling of night has rendered visible.</p>

<hr class="hr10" />

<p>Although the preceding remarks are probably sufficient for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
their principal purpose&mdash;these pages may fall into the hands of
persons familiar with the subject, to whom the following observations
may be addressed, as some of the <i>reasons</i> for what has been
so briefly, if not too positively outlined.</p>

<p>As the mercurial column rises with increase of pressure by the
atmosphere, and descends when the pressure diminishes, it indicates
a greater or less accumulation of air, which, like other fluid,
such as water (when heaped above its average level or reduced
below it, from whatever cause),&mdash;will have a tendency to fall or
rise till the general equilibrium is restored. An observer may
be under the centre of such accumulation or depression, he may
be more or less distant from it, though within the influence of
whatever horizontal movement of air may be caused by such
temporary increase or diminution of pressure. Hence the barometer
shows, and generally foretells, changes of wind; but as
complications always occur, and as changes are of greater or less
extent, affecting or extending through a wider or more limited
area, accompanied by hygrometric and electrical alterations, it is
extremely difficult at times to say beforehand what particular
change of weather is to be expected, and at what interval of
time; although after the event the correspondence of barometric
changes with those of the weather can be readily traced. However,
notwithstanding occasional perplexity, the general character
of weather during the next few days may be predicted by an
observer who understands the nature and use of this instrument
and the thermometer, and has watched them in the few immediately
preceding days.</p>

<p>In endeavouring to foretell weather, the general peculiarity
should always be remembered, that the barometric column usually
stands higher with easterly than it does with westerly winds;
and with winds from the polar regions higher than with those
from the direction of the equator. Hence the highest columns
are observed with north-east winds in northern latitudes, and
with south-east in the southern hemisphere.</p>

<p>In middle latitudes there is an average difference (unreduced
or observed height as read off) of about half an inch, other things
being similar, between the heights of the mercury with North-easterly,
and with South-westerly winds.</p>

<p>The steadier the column, or the more gradually it moves, the more
settled in character will the weather be, and conversely: because
it shows a quiet settled state of the atmosphere; or, if otherwise,
the reverse. In the tropics, when the barometric column moves<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
contrary to its usual daily motion, inferior weather may be expected
(temporarily), because the usual air currents are disturbed.</p>

<p>This regular movement, whether tidal, or otherwise connected
with the sun's influence&mdash;sensible in tropical latitudes, but more
or less masked elsewhere&mdash;amounts to nearly two-tenths of an
inch near the equator, the highest being at about nine, and
the lowest near three o'clock.</p>

<hr class="hr10" />

<p>Some movements of the atmosphere may be illustrated by
reference to the motion of water drawn off from a reservoir by
a small opening below; or by similar <i>upward</i> draught through a
syphon; or by a gradual pouring in at the upper surface.</p>

<p>From a slight motion at the commencement, affecting only
that portion of the fluid adjoining either of those places of
diminution or repletion, gradually all the water becomes influenced
and acquires more or less rapid movement. But suppose
a long reservoir or canal of fluid which has two such points of
exhaustion or two of such repletion (as imagined above), and
that one of either is near each end of the vessel. If each aperture
be opened at the same moment, equal effects will be caused
in each half of the fluid towards either end of the vessel, but in
the middle there must be a neutral point at which the water
falls, yet has no horizontal motion. The converse takes place in
raising the level. And in the case of fluid drawn off or diminished
in weight at one end while increased by repletion at the
other, the <i>whole</i> body of water will move similarly to that in the
former vessel, but unequally. Hence it is evident, that before
horizontal motion occurs, an augmentation or a diminution of
pressure must take place somewhere more or less remote; and so
it is with the lighter fluid atmosphere,&mdash;which has centres, lines,
or areas of depression towards which currents flow.</p>

<p>Such considerations show in some degree why the barometric
changes usually precede, but sometimes only accompany, changes
of weather: and, though very rarely, occur without any sensible
alteration in the wind current of the atmosphere. An observer
may be near a central point towards which the surrounding
fluid tends,&mdash;or from which it diverges. He may be at the very
farthest limit of the portion of fluid that is so influenced. He
may be at an intermediate point&mdash;or he may be between bodies
of atmosphere tending towards opposite directions.</p>

<p>It has been said, that "a whirlwind which sets an extended
portion of the atmosphere into a state of rapid revolution<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
diminishes the pressure of the atmosphere over that portion of
the earth's surface, and most of all at the centre of the whirl.
The depth of the compressing column of air will, at the centre,
be least, and its weight will be diminished in proportion to the
violence of the wind." Yet this has been controverted with
respect to the <i>general</i> effect of air in horizontal motion, and the
depth of the column in question.</p>

<p>Certainly there are two kinds of whirlwinds&mdash;one caused by
rarefaction, tending to lighten vertical pressure under the vortex,
though not, perhaps, under all the current drawn towards it;
and the other, a consequence of opposing winds, which occasion
huge eddies or whirlwinds of compression.</p>

<p>Some whirlwinds are accompanied by rushes from the upper
atmosphere, from the colder regions, which, mingling with
warmer and moister air near the sea, cause dense clouds. About
their centre it sometimes happens that the barometer falls as
much as two or three inches, showing a diminution of atmospheric
pressure by nearly a tenth part; when it should be expected,
from physical considerations alone, that very dense
clouds would be formed.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<hr class="hr10" />

<p>The column of mercury falls about one tenth of an inch for
each of the first few hundred feet above the sea level, but
varying when it becomes much more elevated.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> Due allowance,
therefore, should be made in observing, when on high land.</p>

<p>The tides are affected by atmospheric pressure, so much that a
rise of one inch in the barometer will have a corresponding fall
in the tides of nine to sixteen inches, or about one foot for each
inch.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<hr class="hr10" />

<p>Vessels sometimes enter docks, or even harbours, where they
have scarcely a foot of water more than their draught; and as
docking, as well as launching large ships, requires a close calculation
of height of water, the state of the barometer becomes of
additional importance on such occasions.</p>

<hr />

<p>To render these pages rather more useful at sea, in <i>any</i> part<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
of the world, a few words about squalls and hurricanes are here
offered to the young seaman.</p>

<p>Generally, squalls are preceded, or accompanied, or followed
by clouds; but the very dangerous "white squall" (of the West
Indies and other regions), is indicated only by a rushing sound,
and by white wave crests.</p>

<p>"Descending squalls" come slanting downwards, off high
land,<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> or from upper regions of atmosphere. They are dangerous,
being sometimes violently strong.</p>

<p>A squall cloud that can be seen through or under is not likely
to bring, or be accompanied by, so much wind as a dark continued
cloud extending beyond the horizon. How the comparative
hardness or softness of clouds foretells more or less wind or
rain, was stated in pages <a href="#Page_13">13</a> and <a href="#Page_14">14</a>.</p>

<p>The expressions "hardening up," "softening," or looking
"greasy," are familiar to seamen: and such very sure indications
are the appearances so designated, that they can hardly be
mistaken.</p>

<p>The rapid or slow rise of a squall cloud&mdash;its more or less
disturbed look&mdash;that is, whether its body is much agitated, and
changing form continually, with broken clouds, or scud, flying
about&mdash;or whether the mass of cloud is shapeless and nearly
quiet, though floating onwards across the sky&mdash;foretells more or
less wind accordingly.</p>

<p>An officer of a watch, with a good eye for clouds and signs of
changing weather, may save his men a great deal of unnecessary
exposure, as well as work, besides economising sails, spars, and
rigging.</p>

<p>In some of the "saws" about wind and weather, there is so
much truth that, though trite and simple, their insertion here
can do no harm.</p>

<p>To these short expressions&mdash;well known, in practice, to the experienced;
a very concise but sure rule may be added, for avoiding
the central or strongest part of a hurricane, cyclone, typhoon,
tornado, or circling storm.</p>

<p>With your face towards the wind, in North latitude, the centre
of the circling, or rotatory storm, will be square to your right.
In South latitude, square to your left.</p>

<p>The apparent veering of the wind, and the approach or retreat
of the dangerous central circle, depend on your position in the
curvilinear whirl or sweep.</p>

<p>Draw a circle;&mdash;mark the direction of the rotation or circulation,
by an arrow with the head towards the left hand (against
the movement of a watch's hands) in North latitude; but towards
the right (or with the hands of a watch) if in South latitude.
The direction of the wind, and the bearing of the centre,
show your position in the meteor, for such it is, though perhaps
hundreds of miles in diameter; and the veering of the wind, or
the contrary, and its change in strength, will show how the
meteor is moving bodily&mdash;over an extensive region, revolving
horizontally&mdash;or inclined at a certain angle to the horizontal
plane.</p>

<p>If the observer be stationary, in North latitude, and the centre
pass on his polar side, he will experience a change of wind
from Southward by the West towards North; but if it pass between
him and the Equator, the change will be from Southward
by the East towards North; but otherwise in South latitude, as
his place in circles sketched will show more clearly than words.
The roughest sketch or diagram, indicating the various directions
of wind, and the course of the meteor's centre, will show more
plainly than descriptions&mdash;which must necessarily vary with
each case, and are tedious.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>Cyclonology, or really meteorology, is simple enough in these
great characteristic effects; but their causes must be the philosopher's
study, rather than that of the young practical seaman.</p>

<p>Were it not for this reflection, one might endeavour to show
how all the great Easterly trade winds&mdash;the no less important
anti-trades,<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> or nearly constant Westerly winds,&mdash;and their complicated
eddying offsets, are all (on greater or smaller scales)
breadths, or zones of atmosphere, alternating, or circulating, or
crossing (superposed or laterally)&mdash;between which, at distant
intervals, occur those strong eddies, or storms, called hurricanes&mdash;typhoons&mdash;tornadoes&mdash;or
cyclones.</p>

<p>The great easterly and westerly movements&mdash;so clearly shown
by philosophers to be the consequences of cold polar currents of
air&mdash;warm equatorial currents&mdash;and diurnal rotation of the
earth;<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> are grand ruling phenomena of meteorology&mdash;to which
storms, and all local changes, occurring but occasionally, are
subordinate and exceptional. Further investigations into electrical
and chemical peculiarities will probably throw additional
light, perhaps the strongest, on meteorological science.</p>

<hr />

<p>In the previous observations, general reference has been made
to mercurial barometers of the ordinary kind; but, excepting the
construction of the instruments themselves, those observations
apply to all barometers, wheel&mdash;aneroid&mdash;or metallic&mdash;and likewise,
of course, to the sympiesometer, which is a modified barometer.
But as these four last-mentioned instruments are scarcely
so familiar as the simplest form of barometer, it may be useful to
add a few words about each of them.</p>

<hr class="hr10" />

<p>The <span class="smcap">Wheel</span> barometer has a syphon tube, partly filled with
mercury, on which, at the short or open end of the tube, a float
moves, to which a line is attached that moves a wheel, carrying
an index.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<hr class="hr10" />

<p><span class="smcap">Aneroid</span> barometers, if often compared with good mercurial
columns, are similar in their indications, and valuable; but it
must be remembered that they are not independent instruments;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
that they are set originally by a barometer,<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> require adjustment
occasionally, and may deteriorate in time, though slowly.</p>

<p>The aneroid is quick in showing the variation of atmospheric
pressure, and to the navigator who knows the difficulty, at times,
of using barometers, this instrument is a great boon, for it can
be placed anywhere, quite out of harm's way, and is not affected
by the ship's motion, although faithfully giving indication of increased
or diminished pressure of air.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> In ascending or descending
elevations, the hand of the aneroid may be seen to move (like
the hand of a watch), showing the height above the level of the
sea, or the difference of level between places of comparison.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>The principle on which it is constructed may be explained in a
few words, without going into a scientific or too minute detail of
its various parts. The weight of a column of air, which in a
common barometer acts on the mercury, in the aneroid presses on
a small circular metal box, from which nearly all air is extracted;
and to this box is connected, by nice mechanical arrangement,
the hand visible over the face of the instrument. When the
atmospheric pressure is lessened on the vacuum box, a spring
acting on levers, turns the hand to the left, and when the pressure
increases, the spring is affected differently, the hand being
turned to the right. It acts in any position, but as it <i>often
varies several hundredths with such a change</i>, it should be held
uniformly, while read off.</p>

<p>The known expansion and contraction of metals under varying
temperatures, caused doubts as to the accuracy of the aneroid
under such changes; but they were partly removed by introducing
into the vacuum box a small portion of gas, as a compensation
for the effects of heat or cold. The gas in the box, changing
it bulk on a change of temperature, was intended to compensate
for the effect on the metals of which the aneroid is made.
Besides which, a further and more, reliable compensation has
lately been effected by a combination of brass and steel bars.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Metallic</span> barometers (in <i>outer</i> shape and size like aneroids)
have not yet been tested adequately in very moist, hot, or cold
air for a sufficient time. They, as well as sympiesometers, are
likewise dependent or secondary instruments, and liable to deterioration.
For limited employment, when sufficiently compared,
they may be very useful, especially in a few cases of electrical
changes not foretold or shown by mercury.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Sympiesometer</span> is considered to be more sensitive than the
marine barometer, falling sooner, and rising earlier: but this is
partly in consequence of the marine barometer tube being contracted,
to prevent oscillation or "pumping." In the sympiesometer
a gas is used, which presses on the confined surface of
the liquid with an uniform pressure at an equal state of temperature.
The liquid is raised or depressed by an increase or
diminution in the density of the atmosphere, and change of
temperature is allowed for, by the sliding scale of the instrument
being always set to agree with the height of the mercury in the
attached thermometer, bringing the <i>pointer</i> on the sliding scale of
the sympiesometer to the same degree on the inverted scale (over
which it slides) as is indicated by the thermometer. The height
of the fluid, as then shown by the sliding scale, indicates the
pressure of the atmosphere.</p>

<p>As the instrument is delicate, great care should be taken, in
carrying or handling, to keep the top always upwards, and to
exclude casual rays of the sun, or a fire, or lamp.</p>

<p>Oil sympiesometers seem to be affected more than mercurial,
or others, and much more than the barometer, by lightning or
electricity. That they, and the hermetically sealed "<span class="smcap">Storm
Glasses</span>," are influenced by causes besides pressure and temperature,
appears now to be certain.</p>

<hr class="hr10" />

<p>The daily movement of the barometer may be noted (in a
form or table of double entry) at the time of each observation,
by a dot at the place corresponding to its altitude, and the time
of observing; which dot should be connected with the previous
one by a line. The resulting free curve (or zig-zag) will show
at a glance what have been the movements during the days
immediately previous, by which, and not merely by the last
observation, a judgment may be formed of the weather to be
expected.</p>

<p>Such a diagram may be filled up by <i>uncorrected</i> observations,
its object being to serve as a weather guide for immediate use,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
rather than for future investigation. If closely kept up, it will
prove to be of utility, and will in some degree reward the trouble
of keeping a regular record. For purely scientific objects much
more nicety and detail are required.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="smcap">Hesitation</span> is sometimes felt by young seamen, at first using
the vernier of a barometer, for want of some such familiar explanation
as the following:&mdash;</p>

<p>The general principle of this moveable dividing scale is, that
the total number of the smallest spaces or subdivisions of the
vernier are made equal, taken altogether, to one less than that
number of the smallest spaces in an equal length of the fixed
scale.</p>

<p>For example: ten spaces on the vernier being made equal to
nine on the scale, each vernier space is one tenth less than a scale
space; and if the first line or division of the vernier agree
exactly with any line of the scale, the next line of the vernier
must be one tenth of a tenth (or one hundredth) of an inch from
agreement with the next <i>scale</i> division; the following vernier line
must be two hundredths out, and so on: therefore, the number
of such differences (from the next tenth on the scale) at which a
vernier line agrees with a scale line, when set, is the number of
hundredths to be added to the said tenth; (in a common barometer,
reading only to hundredths of an inch).</p>

<p>The vernier of a barometer reading to thousandths of an inch,
is on a similar principle, though differently divided. In this
application of it, generally, twenty-five vernier spaces equal
twenty-four of the scale spaces, which are each half a tenth, or
five hundredths of an inch; therefore, the difference between one
of the vernier and one of the scale is two-tenths of a hundredth,
or two thousandths of an inch [25)&middot;050(&middot;002].</p>

<p>This is the usual graduation of scientific barometers; but for
ordinary purposes, as weather-glasses, a division, or reading, to
the hundredth of an inch is sufficient.</p>

<p>When set properly, the vernier straight edge, the top of the
mercury, and the observer's eye, should be on the same level;
the edge (or pointer) just <i>touching</i><a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> the middle and uppermost
point of the column.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>
<p>Great care should be taken to look thus square, or at right
angles to the scale.</p>

<p>Light, or something white, at the <i>back</i> of the tube, assists in
accurately setting the vernier, and may be shifted about to aid
in reading off.</p>

<hr class="hr10" />

<p><span class="smcap">The Aneroid</span> has been recommended, in these pages, as a
weather-glass; but it may increase its usefulness to append a
table for measuring heights (approximately) by this, or any barometer,
which can be compared with another, or itself, at a higher
or lower station.</p>

<p>If the measure of a height rather greater than the aneroid will
commonly show, be required, it may be <i>re-set</i> thus&mdash;When at
the upper station (<i>within its range</i>), and having noted the
reading carefully, touch the screw behind so as to bring back
the hand a few inches (if the instrument will admit), then read
off and start again. <i>Reverse the operation when descending.</i>
This may add some inches of measure <i>approximately</i>.</p>

<hr />

<p>In the following Table, the difference between the number of
feet opposite the height of a barometer, at one station, and that
at another station, is their approximate difference of height.</p>

<h2><a name="MARINE_BAROMETER" id="MARINE_BAROMETER"></a>MARINE BAROMETER,
<small><small><br /><br />ADOPTED BY<br /><br /></small></small>
HER MAJESTY'S GOVERNMENT,
<small><small><br /><br /><i>On the recommendation of the Kew Observatory Committee of the<br />
British Association for the Advancement of Science.</i></small></small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> instrument should be suspended in a good light for reading,
but out of the reach of sunshine or the heat of a fire or lamp.
It should be as nearly amidships, and exposed as little to sudden
changes of temperature, gusts of wind, or injuries, as possible.
In a ship of war it should be below the lowest battery or gun-deck.
Light should have access to the back of the tube, to
admit of setting the index so as to have its lower edge a tangent
to the surface of the mercury&mdash;the eye being on the same level,
which is known by the back and front edges of the index being
in one line with the mercury surface. White paper or card will
reflect light for setting the vernier correctly. The height of the
cistern above or below the ship's water-line should be ascertained,
and entered on the register.</p>

<p>It is desirable to place the barometer in such a position as not
to be in danger of a side blow, and also sufficiently far from the
deck above to allow for the spring of the metal arm in cases of
sudden movements of the ship.</p>

<p>If there is risk of the instrument striking anywhere when the
vessel is much inclined, it will be desirable either to put some
soft padding on that place, or to check movement in that direction
by a light elastic cord; in fixing which, attention must
be paid to have it acting only where risk of a blow begins,
not interfering otherwise with the free swing of the instrument:
a very light cord attached above, when possible, will
be least likely to interfere injuriously.</p>

<p>The vernier, as usual in standard barometers, reads to the
two thousandth (&middot;002) part of an inch. Every long line cut on
the vernier corresponds to &middot;01 part; each small division on the
scale is &middot;05; the hundredth parts on the vernier being added to
the five when its lower edge is next above one of the short lines;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
or written down as shown by the figures on the vernier only,
when next above one of the divisions marking tenths.</p>

<p>In placing this barometer, it is only necessary to fix the
instrument carefully, as indicated in the above directions, and
give a few gentle taps with the fingers on the bottom, to
move the mercury. Without further operation it will usually
be ready for observation in less than an hour.</p>

<p>When moving the barometer, or replacing it in its case, the
mercury should be allowed to run gently up to the top of the
tube, by holding the instrument for a few minutes inclined at
an angle. The vernier should be brought down to the bottom
of the scale. No other adjustment for portability is required.
During carriage, it ought to be kept with the cistern end uppermost,
or lying flat, the former position being preferable.</p>

<p>If the mercury should not descend at first by a few gentle
taps, use sharper (but of course without violence), by which, and
two or three taps, with the finger ends, on the tube&mdash;between
the scale and the tangent screw&mdash;the mercury will be made
to begin to descend.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap"><big>Testing Barometers, Hydrometers, and Thermometers.</big></span></p>

<p>In the year 1853 a conference of maritime nations was held
at Brussels, on the subject of meteorology at sea. The report
of this conference was laid before Parliament, and the result
was a vote of money for the purchase of instruments and the
discussion of observations, under the superintendence of the
Board of Trade. Arrangements were then made, in accordance
with the views of the Royal Society and the British Association
for the Advancement of Science, for the supply of instruments
properly tested.</p>

<p>In the barometers now in general use by meteorologists
on land, the diameters of the tubes are nearly equal throughout
their whole length, and a provision is made for adjusting
the mercury in the cistern to the zero point, previous to reading
the height of the top of the column. The object of the latter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
arrangement, it is well known, is to avoid the necessity of applying
a correction to the readings for the difference of capacity
between the cistern and the tube. At sea, barometers of this
construction cannot be used. Part of the tube of the marine
barometer must be very much contracted to prevent "pumping,"
and the motion of the ship would render it impracticable to
adjust the mercury in the cistern to the zero point. In the
barometer usually employed on shore, the index error is the same
throughout the whole range of scale readings, if the instrument
be properly made; but in nearly all the barometers which have
till recently been employed at sea, the index correction varies
through the range of scale readings, in proportion to the difference
of capacity between the cistern and the tube. To find
the index correction for a land barometer, comparison with a
Standard at any part of the scale at which the mercury may
happen to be, is generally considered sufficient. To test the
marine barometer is a work of much more time, since it is
necessary to find the correction for scale readings at about each
half inch throughout the range of atmospheric pressure to which
it may be exposed; and it becomes necessary to have recourse to
artificial means of changing the pressure of the atmosphere on
the surface of the mercury in the cistern.</p>

<p>The barometers intended to be tested are placed, together with
a Standard, in an air-tight chamber, to which an air pump is
applied, so that, by partially exhausting the air, the Standard
can be made to read much lower than the lowest pressure to
which marine barometers are likely to be exposed; and by compressing
the air it can be made to read higher than the mercury
ever stands at the level of the sea. The tube of the Standard is
contracted similarly to that of the marine barometer, but a provision
is made for adjusting the mercury in its cistern to the zero
point. Glass windows are inserted in the upper part of the iron
air-chamber, through which the scales of the barometers may be
seen; but as the verniers cannot be moved in the usual way from
outside the chamber, a provision is made for reading the height
of the mercury independent of the verniers attached to the scales
of the respective barometers. At a distance of some five or six
feet from the air-tight chamber a vertical scale is fixed. The
divisions on this scale correspond exactly with those on the tube
of the Standard barometer. A vernier and telescope are made
to slide on the scale by means of a rack and pinion. The telescope
has two horizontal wires, one fixed, and the other moveable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
by a micrometer, screw so that the difference between the height
of the column of mercury and the nearest division on the scale of
the Standard, and also of all the other barometers placed by the
side of it for comparison, can be measured either with the vertical
scale and vernier or the micrometer wire. The means are thus
possessed of testing barometers for index error in any part of the
scale, through the whole range of atmospheric pressure to which
they are likely to be exposed, and the usual practice is to test
them at every half inch from 27&middot;5 to 31 inches.</p>

<p>In this way barometers of various other descriptions have been
tested, and their errors found to be so large that some barometers
read half an inch and upwards too high, while others read as
much too low. In some cases those which were correct in one
part of the scale were found to be from half an inch to an inch
wrong in other parts. These barometers were of the old and
ordinary construction. In some the mercury would not descend
lower than about 29 inches, owing to a fault very common in
the construction of the marine barometer till lately in general
use, that the cistern was not large enough to hold the mercury
which descended from the tube in a low atmospheric pressure.</p>

<p>The practice which has long prevailed of mounting the marine
barometer in wood is objectionable. The instrument recently
introduced agreeably to the recommendation of the Kew Committee,
is greatly superior to any other description of marine
barometer which has yet been tested, as regards the accuracy with
which it indicates the pressure of the atmosphere. The diameter
of the cistern is about an inch and a quarter, and that of the
tube about a quarter of an inch. The scale, instead of being
divided into inches in the usual way, is shortened in the proportion
of about 0&middot;04 of an inch for every inch. The object of
shortening the scale is to avoid the necessity of applying a correction
for difference of capacity between the cistern and the
tube. The perfection with which this is done may be judged of
from the fact, that of the first twelve barometers tested at the
Liverpool Observatory with an apparatus exactly similar to that
used at Kew (whence these instruments were sent by railway,
after being tested and certified), the index corrections in the two
pressures of 28 and 31 inches in three of them were the same;
two differed 0&middot;001 of an inch; and for the remainder the differences
ranged from 0&middot;002 to 0&middot;006 of an inch. The corrections for
capacity were therefore considered perfect, and, with one unimportant
exception, agreed with those given at Kew.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>In order to check the pumping of the mercury at sea, the
tubes of these barometers are so contracted, through a few
inches, that, when first suspended, the mercury is perhaps
twenty minutes in falling from the top of the tube to its proper
level. When used on shore, this contraction of the tube causes
the marine barometer to be always a little behind an ordinary
barometer, the tube of which is not contracted. The amount
varies according to the rate at which the mercury is rising or
falling, and ranges from 0&middot;00 to 0&middot;02 of an inch. As the motion
of the ship at sea causes the mercury to pass more rapidly
through the contracted tube, the readings are almost the same
there as they would be if the tube were not contracted, and
in no case do they differ enough to be of importance in maritime
use.</p>

<p>The method of testing thermometers is so simple as scarcely to
require explanation. For the freezing point, the bulbs and a
considerable portion of the tubes of the thermometers, are immersed
in pounded ice. For the higher temperatures, the thermometers
are placed in a cylindrical glass vessel containing water
of the required heat; and the scales of the thermometers intended
to be tested, together with the Standard with which they
are to be compared, are read through the glass. In this way the
scale readings maybe tested at any required degree of temperature,
and the usual practice is to test them at every ten degrees
from 32&deg; to 92&deg; of Fahrenheit. For this range of 60&deg; the
makers who supply Government are limited to 0&middot;6 of a degree as
a maximum error of scale reading; but so accurately are these
thermometers made, that it has not been found necessary to
reject more than a very few of them.</p>

<hr />

<p>Hydrometers are tested by careful immersion in pure distilled
water; of which the specific gravity is taken as unity.</p>

<p>In water less pure, more salt, dense, and buoyant, the instrument
floats higher, carrying more of the graduated scale out of
the fluid.</p>

<p>The zero of the scale should be level with the surface of distilled
water, and rise above it in proportion as increase of
density causes less displacement.</p>

<p>The scale is graduated to thousandths&mdash;as far as &middot;040 only&mdash;because
the sea water usually ranges between 1&middot;014 and about
1&middot;036. Only the last two figures need be marked.</p>
